 * namespace to SwiftypeMetaTag, it seemed that no matter what I did, SwiftypeMetaTag was unable to find the Interface
 * and I would just get php errors any time I tried to instantiate a MetaTag class.
 *
 * Moving them into the same namespace was the only way I was able to move forward without going down a rabbit hole.
